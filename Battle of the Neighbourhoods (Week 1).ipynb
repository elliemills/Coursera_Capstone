The statistics also show that 1 in 3 Americans have tried Yoga in the last 6 months and spend a total of $16 billion on classes and equipment each year.   Yoga has a number of health benefits including improving flexibility, building muscle strength, perfecting posture and preventing cartilage and joint breakdown (2).\n\n### 1.2.\tProblem\nMy client has come to me for advice on a suitable location to open a new Yoga studio in Toronto.  They would like to discover how many Yoga studios there currently are in the city and in which neighbourhoods they are located.  They would like to know how this compares to other similar size cities, where the Yoga studios are located in these cities and what other amenities are close by.  \nThe city I will use for segmentation and clustering comparison will be New York City.\n\n### 1.3.\tInterest\nYoga is enjoyed by all ages.  The chosen location could be in the CBD area to attract office workers to keep them active during their working day.  Or alternatively the location could be in the suburbs where they may attract retirees or stay at home parents during the day.  My client is flexible on location and would like to locate the studio in the location where he can expect to attract the most clients. \n\n##### 1. https://www.thegoodbody.com/yoga-statistics/\n##### 2. https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/count-yoga-38-ways-yoga-keeps-fit\n\n\n## 2.\tData acquisition and cleaning\n### 2.1.\tData Sources\nThe following sources will be used for the investigation:\n\n1.\tNeighbourhoods of New York data: https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n2.\tNeighbourhoods of Toronto data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M \n3.\tGeospatial Coordinates of Toronto: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n4.\tFoursquare - a technology company with a massive dataset of location data.  A Foursquare API developer account is required and queries can be run on chosen locations using your Foursquare API Client ID and Client Secret.  \n\n## 2.2.\tData Cleaning\n### 2.2.1.\tNew York dataset (data source 1)\nA dataset that contains the New York boroughs and neighbourhoods as well as the latitude and longitude coordinates is already in existence and can be used for this project.  A wget command is used to download the dataset into a json file and then transfom it into a pandas dataframe for analysis\u2013 an empty dataframe is set up and then the data looped through. \n\n### 2.2.2.\tToronto dataset (data sources 2 and 3)\nThere is no existing dataset showing both neighbourhoods and coordinates so this is created using 2 datasets.  The Neighbourhoods of Toronto data set is imported as a pandas dataframe (or by using the BeautifulSoup package) and the data is cleaned and the duplicates removed.  Where data is missing for a Post Code, these boroughs are removed and in the case of missing data for a neighbourhood, then the borough is used.\nThe Geospatial csv data file is then also imported as a pandas dataframe and the 2 tables merged together using Post Code which is included in both datasets. \nWe then have a complete table including borough and neighbourhood and the longitude and latitude coordinates. \n\n## 2.3.\tMethodology\n### 2.3.1.\tFoursquare\nFoursquare API will be used to locate existing Yoga studios in each location and to explore the area around the venue.  The longitude and latitude coordinates will be used on both New York City and Toronto, the search query will be set to \u2018Yoga\u2019 and a search radius of 4km.  A URL is generated using this data along with Client ID and Client Secret.  A Get request is sent as a JSON file and then transformed into a pandas dataframe. \nFolium is then used to visualise the Yoga studios on a map of the Cities. \nWe can then select a Yoga studio from the results to explore the area and see what else tends to be located around a Yoga studio and see if there are any patterns.  If the Yoga studios have been rated we can also obtain to help determine the most popular ones. \n\n### 2.3.2.\tK-means Clustering\nWe can use K-means clustering the neighbourhoods based on similarities and in each cluster identify the top 10 venues.  We can also use this to determine which neighbourhoods, if any, have a Yoga studio within the top 10. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
